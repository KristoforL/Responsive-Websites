# Responsive-Websites
This is where a few months of research an practice landed me after I made the content in MY HTML repository:
https://github.com/KristoforL/My-HTML

This repository will have have been based and evolved from MY-HTML and will exhibit Responsive website tendencies. This was my next project and have been a great test of my ability to make a website from scratch and understand what the foundation of a website is and how the tools work together to make a site react.

This website was created utilizing JavaScript and CSS stylings. Please enjoy and try on multiple devices

This is approaaching end of life because it has been further evolved and moved to another Repository for online portfolio purposes
