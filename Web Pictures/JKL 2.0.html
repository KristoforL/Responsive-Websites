								My name is Jacquawn but I have told many people to call me Kris. I have been working on building my skills in web site building and creating responsive designs for those who want to promote their business and provide an easy way for their clients to reach them and see what it is that they have to offer.

									Well there is a difference in the names that I give you and I prefer to go by Kris (Kristofor) but feel free to call me either Jacquawn or Kris I will answer to both. I have been interested in programming since middle school but never had the means until about junior year of high school. After attending college i found that I was in more than I expected to be. Both fun and challenging I found what it was that I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

									I enjoy a plethora of activities in by spare time. I enjoy being with my family actually doing somthing together. I love camping, playing sports of all kind, volunteering, and attending concerts. I still enjoy video games. I love the challenge I present myself in life and no one will be able to stop me from living because it is what I do. I have no reason to not enjoy everyday I wake up and I get up for the same reason everyday.

								Fun face about me is I would like to think of myself as unbeatable. I am the only person can beat myself up. I am not easily stopped or defeated. I will not be defeated, beaten, short handed, conquered, until my time is up. I know why I do what I do everyday. I am the only person that can do what I do the way I do what I do or do it how I can do it, because I keep getting better at what I do so that others stay at my wayside ready to challenge me.
